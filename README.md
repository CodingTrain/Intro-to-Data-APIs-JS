# Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript

This is a working document outlining future plans for a new Coding Train playlist: "Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript."


## Description

This course is for aspiring developers who want to learn how to work with data in web applications. How do you find, collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data? I’ll start with the basics of data formats: CSV, XML, and JSON. I’ll then cover how to use Promises and the JavaScript fetch() function to load data asynchronously on a webpage. I’ll do case studies of several APIs and explain how to sign up and authenticate, make a request, and load the data. I’ll look at how this works for both client-side and server-side code. I’ll demonstrate how to visualize the data using HTML5 Canvas and p5.js. The course will end with a demonstration for how to analyze data using modern machine learning techniques such as classification, regression, and clustering.

## Sample Lesson

The “Hello World” of working with APIs is often a Weather API (e.g. https://openweathermap.org/). A lesson would start with how to sign up and authenticate with the API, create a request for data, make that request, and display the data on a web page. I would show how to create common visualizations (like bar charts of temperature data) as well as more creative ones (a rain or snow animation depending on precipitation.)
